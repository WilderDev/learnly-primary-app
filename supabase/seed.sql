-- Our goal is to create 7 "CORE" topics and 2 "ELECTIVE" topic for every subject in the curriculum. And for every "CORE" topic create 5 "CORE" lessons and 2 "ELECTIVE" lessons. For every "ELECTIVE" topic, create 4 "CORE" lessons and 2 "ELECTIVE" lessons.
-- Every Topic and Lesson should have an inspiration one sentence descriptions like "A playful wonderland of learning that ignites curiosity, nurtures creativity, and lays the foundations for a lifelong love of exploration."
-- We are doing a curriculum called Comprehensive K-5 split into 6 levels (Kindergarten, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
-- Right Now, your job is to create the first topic and ALL the lessons for that topic for Kindergarten Computer Science.
-- the output will look like:
