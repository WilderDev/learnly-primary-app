-- Our goal is to create 7 "CORE" topics and 2 "ELECTIVE" topic for every subject in the curriculum. And for every "CORE" topic create 5 "CORE" lessons and 2 "ELECTIVE" lessons. For every "ELECTIVE" topic, create 4 "CORE" lessons and 2 "ELECTIVE" lessons.
-- Every Topic and Lesson should have an inspiration one sentence descriptions like "A playful wonderland of learning that ignites curiosity, nurtures creativity, and lays the foundations for a lifelong love of exploration."
-- We are doing a curriculum called STEM K-5 split into 6 levels (Kindergarten, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
-- Right Now, your job is to create the first 4 topics and ALL the lessons for those topics for level 5 Mathematics.
-- the output will look like:

--        "description": "Fostering teamwork and coordination through simple team sports and games.",

-- Our goal is to create 7 "CORE" topics and 2 "ELECTIVE" topic for every subject in the curriculum. And for every "CORE" topic create 5 "CORE" lessons and 2 "ELECTIVE" lessons. For every "ELECTIVE" topic, create 4 "CORE" lessons and 2 "ELECTIVE" lessons.
-- Every Topic and Lesson should have an inspiration one sentence descriptions like "A playful wonderland of learning that ignites curiosity, nurtures creativity, and lays the foundations for a lifelong love of exploration."
-- We are doing a curriculum called STEM K-5 split into 6 levels (Kindergarten, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
-- Right Now, your job is to create the first 4 topics and ALL the lessons for those topics for level 5 Science.
-- the output will look like:

-- Our goal is to create 7 "CORE" topics and 2 "ELECTIVE" topic for every subject in the curriculum. And for every "CORE" topic create 5 "CORE" lessons and 2 "ELECTIVE" lessons. For every "ELECTIVE" topic, create 4 "CORE" lessons and 2 "ELECTIVE" lessons.
-- Every Topic and Lesson should have an inspiration one sentence descriptions like "A playful wonderland of learning that ignites curiosity, nurtures creativity, and lays the foundations for a lifelong love of exploration."
-- We are doing a curriculum called STEM K-5 split into 6 levels (Kindergarten, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
-- Right Now, your job is to create the first 4 topics and ALL the lessons for those topics for level 5 Computer Science.
-- the output will look like:

-- Our goal is to create 7 "CORE" topics and 2 "ELECTIVE" topic for every subject in the curriculum. And for every "CORE" topic create 5 "CORE" lessons and 2 "ELECTIVE" lessons. For every "ELECTIVE" topic, create 4 "CORE" lessons and 2 "ELECTIVE" lessons.
-- Every Topic and Lesson should have an inspiration one sentence descriptions like "A playful wonderland of learning that ignites curiosity, nurtures creativity, and lays the foundations for a lifelong love of exploration."
-- We are doing a curriculum called STEM K-5 split into 6 levels (Kindergarten, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
-- Right Now, your job is to create the first 4 topics and ALL the lessons for those topics for level 5 Engineering.
-- the output will look like:

-- Our goal is to create 7 "CORE" topics and 2 "ELECTIVE" topic for every subject in the curriculum. And for every "CORE" topic create 5 "CORE" lessons and 2 "ELECTIVE" lessons. For every "ELECTIVE" topic, create 4 "CORE" lessons and 2 "ELECTIVE" lessons.
-- Every Topic and Lesson should have an inspiration one sentence descriptions like "A playful wonderland of learning that ignites curiosity, nurtures creativity, and lays the foundations for a lifelong love of exploration."
-- We are doing a curriculum called STEM K-5 split into 6 levels (Kindergarten, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
-- Right Now, your job is to create the first 4 topics and ALL the lessons for those topics for level 5 Critical Thinking & Problem Solving.
-- the output will look like:

-- Our goal is to create 7 "CORE" topics and 2 "ELECTIVE" topic for every subject in the curriculum. And for every "CORE" topic create 5 "CORE" lessons and 2 "ELECTIVE" lessons. For every "ELECTIVE" topic, create 4 "CORE" lessons and 2 "ELECTIVE" lessons.
-- Every Topic and Lesson should have an inspiration one sentence descriptions like "A playful wonderland of learning that ignites curiosity, nurtures creativity, and lays the foundations for a lifelong love of exploration."
-- We are doing a curriculum called STEM K-5 split into 6 levels (Kindergarten, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
-- Right Now, your job is to create the first 4 topics and ALL the lessons for those topics for level 5 Environmental Studies.
-- the output will look like:
-- {
--        "name": "Team Sports",
--        "description": "Fostering teamwork and coordination through simple team sports and games.",
--        "image_path": "https://source.unsplash.com/500x500/?team-sports",

-- Our goal is to create 7 "CORE" topics and 2 "ELECTIVE" topic for every subject in the curriculum. And for every "CORE" topic create 5 "CORE" lessons and 2 "ELECTIVE" lessons. For every "ELECTIVE" topic, create 4 "CORE" lessons and 2 "ELECTIVE" lessons.
-- Every Topic and Lesson should have an inspiration one sentence descriptions like "A playful wonderland of learning that ignites curiosity, nurtures creativity, and lays the foundations for a lifelong love of exploration."
-- We are doing a curriculum called STEM K-5 split into 6 levels (Kindergarten, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
-- Right Now, your job is to create the first 4 topics and ALL the lessons for those topics for level 5 Programming & Robotics.
-- the output will look like:

-- Our goal is to create 7 "CORE" topics and 2 "ELECTIVE" topic for every subject in the curriculum. And for every "CORE" topic create 5 "CORE" lessons and 2 "ELECTIVE" lessons. For every "ELECTIVE" topic, create 4 "CORE" lessons and 2 "ELECTIVE" lessons.
-- Every Topic and Lesson should have an inspiration one sentence descriptions like "A playful wonderland of learning that ignites curiosity, nurtures creativity, and lays the foundations for a lifelong love of exploration."
-- We are doing a curriculum called STEM K-5 split into 6 levels (Kindergarten, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
-- Right Now, your job is to create the first 4 topics and ALL the lessons for those topics for level 5 Astronomy.
-- the output will look like:
